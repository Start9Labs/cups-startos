# Cups Messenger

## Config
If you choose to change your random, default Cups password, we recommend using an equally complex password and relying on your Bitwarden Server to to save it.

**Note**: You can change your password at any time by visiting the Cups Config in your Embassy app.

## Platforms
You can use Cups in the browser or through the mobile app.

### Browser
1. Copy/paste your Cups Tor address into any Tor-enabled browser. Options include:
   * Start9 Consulate (recommended)
   * Tor Browser
   * Firefox (with SOCKS5 proxy enabled)
   * Brave (with SOCKS5 proxy enabled)
2. Log in using your Cups password, located in the "Config" section of your Embassy Cups service.
3. Bookmark the site for future visits, or better yet, save it to your Bitwarden server!

### Mobile App (iOS and Android)
1. Download the Cups Messenger app from the App Store or Google Play Store.
2. Log in using your Cups password, located in the "Config" section of your Embassy Cups service.

## Tips
- Cups does not currently offer notifications, which are notoriously difficult to perform in a trustless. This means you will need to check your Cups app to see if you have new messages. There will be notification in the future.
- Currently, Cups is a single-user service, meaning only you are meant to log in to your Cups service. This also means you can only message with people who are also running a Cups service. In the future, you will be able to create guest accounts, such that you can chat with anyone simple by giving them your Cups Tor address and an special invite code.
